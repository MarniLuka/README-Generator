# Professional README Generator

## Description

Using only JavaScript, we had to create a way to generate a proper README file. Node.JS and Inquirer were used to accomplish this.

## Usage

To start generating a READEME.md file, you have to run 'node index.js' in your terminal. Answer the following questions as you would when writing a normal README. If there's no information to input for a certain question, simply write N/A. Upon finishing all the questions, you should receive a message stating 'Created README file.' This means that the file was successfully created. If you receive an error, then you should try again.
